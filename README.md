# Text Style Transfer
Text style transfer is an emerging subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that aims to automatically transform the style of a given text while preserving its meaning. The task involves transferring the linguistic features of one style to another, such as changing the tone, formality or politeness level of a task. Text Style Transfer is a challenging problem due to the complex nature of language and the need for preserving semantic coherence. Recent advancaed in deep learning techniques have shown promising results in this area.

## Implemented models:
- Seq2Seq model with attention mechanism: Seq2Seq models are a powerfool tool for generating sentences. Comprised of an encoder and a decoder, the implemented model receives the tokens of an informal sentence and generates the corresponding formal tokens. But that's not all - with the implementation of the attention mechanism, the model can leverage the hiiden states outputted at different time-steps by the encoder guide the decoder in generating even more accurate tokens. You can find the implementations of this model at this file.
